1. Routes with the highest shipment costs **and** average delay > 6 hours
----------------------------------------------------------------
Returns each offending route alongside: total & average shipment
cost, average delay, and basic route metadata. Ordered by total
cost descending so that management can focus on the priciest
problem areas first.

2. Ranking carriers by unreliability (late-delivery count)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Assumes that the `shipments` table has a `carrier_id` FK and a
STATUS column where the value 'late' marks overdue deliveries.
If your data marks lateness differently, adjust the predicate in
late_shipments CTE.

3. Regional delivery performance comparison
----------------------------------------------------------------
Computes average transit time per **origin region**. Transit time
is the difference between `delivery_date` and `ship_date` in days.
Adjust expressions if you prefer hours.
